"""Gaussian blur for QPixmaps.

The frosted-glass look depends on a genuine separable Gaussian blur of the
pixels sitting behind the panel. We lean on Qt's own ``QGraphicsBlurEffect``
(rendered through an offscreen scene) so the result is fast and high quality,
while taking care to keep the device-pixel-ratio correct on Retina displays.
